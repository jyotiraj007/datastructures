What is graph?
Ans: Graph is a pair of sets (V,G)

Why we need graph?
Ans: To solve problems like, shortest path, all possible paths, spanning tree etc

What are the important terminologies of graph?
Ans: 1) Vertices, 2) Edges, 3) Unweighted Graph, 4) Weighted Graph, 5) Undirected Graph, 6) Directed Graph, 7) Cyclic Graph, 8) Acyclic Graph, 9) Tree --> Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)

1) Adjacency Matrix
2) Adjacency List

What is dense graph?
Ans: Dense graph is when |E| = |V|^2

What is sparse graph?
Ans: Sparse graph is when |E| = |V|

When to use which representation?
Ans: In case of dense graph Adjacency Matrix Representation is recommended
and in case of sparse graph Adjacency List Representation is recommended
