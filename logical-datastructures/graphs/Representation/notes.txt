Adjacency Matrix
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdjacencyMatrix.html
The adjacency matrix, sometimes also called the connection matrix, of a simple labeled graph is a matrix with rows and columns labeled by graph vertices,
with a 1 or 0 in position (v_i,v_j) according to whether v_i and v_j are adjacent or not.
For a simple graph with no self-loops, the adjacency matrix must have 0s on the diagonal.
For an undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.

Adjacency List
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdjacencyList.html
The adjacency list representation of a graph consists of n lists one for each vertex v_i, 1<=i<=n, which gives the vertices to which v_i is adjacent.

What is Sparse Matrix
http://www.btechsmartclass.com/data_structures/sparse-matrix.html
In computer programming, a matrix can be defined with a 2-dimensional array. Any array with 'm' columns and 'n' rows represent a m X n matrix.
There may be a situation in which a matrix contains more number of ZERO values than NON-ZERO values. Such matrix is known as sparse matrix.
